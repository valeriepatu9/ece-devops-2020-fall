# DevOps

Is a culture, mindsets.

In 2014, we started speaking about DevOps (in [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/))

# What is DevOps?

- Approach of Software engineering and release
- Quick iterative process
- Tasks automation
- Monitor everything, every step
- Present in a lot of fields: Sysadmin, Data Engeneering, Data Science
- You can’t do DevOps alone

# Why DevOps?

- Faster Time To Market
- Recovery time is reduced
- Problems are easier to detect
- System is overall more stable
- (Most) Repetitive tasks are automated
- You have less and less time available as the workload increases. Automation is essential

# The Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

# Agile Principles

- Customer satisfaction is top priority
- Project requirements can change
- Do frequent deliveries
- Business & Devs must collaborate throughout the project
- Project actors must be motivated
- Prefer face-to-face conversations
- A working software is the main measure of progress
- Project pace should be sustainable and be maintained
- Pay attention to technical aspects and design
- Keep it simple
- Teams should be self-organised
- Reflect on the progress and process used regularly

# Scrum

- Light management method built on :
  - Transparency
  - Inspection
  - Adaptation
- Features are developed in a « Sprint »
- The « Scrum Master » coaches the Dev Team
- The « Product Owner » represents and interacts with the final client
- Progression is tracked during the « Daily Scrum Meeting »
