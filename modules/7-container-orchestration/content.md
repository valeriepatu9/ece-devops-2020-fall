# Container orchestration

**Requirements for Container-Based applications:**

- manage containers
- ensure that there is no downtime (SLA requirement)
  
**Container orchestration tools provide:**

- deployment
- management
- scaling
- networking

## Containers complexity

- Provisioning and deployment
- Configuration and scheduling 
- Resource allocation
- Container availability 
- Scaling or removing containers based on balancing workloads across your infrastructure
- Load balancing and traffic routing 
- Monitoring container health
- Configuring applications based on the container in which they will run
- Keeping interactions between containers secure

## Container orchestration tools

- **Kubernetes**
- Docker Compose (has limited functionality)
- Docker Swarm
- Apache Mesos

## Kubernetes 

**Kubernetes** - an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Provides:**

- Automated rollouts and roll backs
- Service health monitoring
- Automatic scaling of services
- Declarative management
- Deploy anywhere, including hybrid deployments
- Storage orchestration

## Kubernetes cluster

Consists of:

- **Master** - coordinates the cluster
- **Nodes** - workers that run applications

## Kubernetes objects

**Kubernetes objects** - persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of the cluster:

- Running containers
- Available resources
- Policies

**Objects:**

- Pod
- Deployment
- Service
- ...

## Kubernetes Objects: Pods

**Pods** are (an abstraction of containers):

- the smallest deployable units of computing
- group of one or more containers (tightly coupled)
- could be *replicated* (scaled horizontally)
- ephemeral, disposable entities (The Pod remains on the node until the Pod finishes execution, the Pod object is deleted, the Pod is evicted for lack of resources, or the node fails.)

Example of `.yaml` (or `.yml`) file:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
    volumeMounts:
    - name: redis-storage
      mountPath: /data/redis
  volumes:
  - name: redis-storage
    emptyDir: {}
```

## Kubernetes Objects: Deployment

Provides declarative updates for Pods (an abstraction of Pods).

You describe a **desired state** in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state.

Example:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Kubernetes Objects: Service

An abstract (abstraction of network) way to expose an application running on a set of Pods **as a network service**.

With Kubernetes you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

Example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
```

## Kubernetes object management

| Management technique             | Operates on          |Recommended environment |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Imperative commands              | Live objects         | Development projects   |
| Imperative object configuration  | Individual files     | Production projects    |
| Declarative object configuration | Directories of files | Production projects    |

**Examples:**

Imperative commands:
```
kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx
```

Imperative object configuration:

```
kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
kubectl delete -f nginx.yaml -f redis.yaml
```

Declarative object configuration:
```
kubectl apply -f path/to/folder/
```

## Organizing resource configurations

```
project/k8s/development
├── deployment
│   └── my-deployment.yaml
└── service
    └── my-service.yaml
```

## Storage in Pods

Kubernetes volumes:
- similar to Docker volumes
- samy types supported

Volume types:
- `emptyDir` - ephemeral (exist as long as Pod is running on that Node)
- `hostPath` - mounts a directory from the Node
- ... many of other types

## Networking

**Communications types:**

1. Highly-coupled container-to-container   
  Solved by Pods and `localhost`
2. Pod-to-Pod   
  Pods on a node can communicate with all pods on all nodes
3. Pod-to-Service   
  Covered by Services
4. External-to-Service   
  Covered by Ingress

## Minikube

- Tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally
- Runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM)
- Perfect to get started with Kubernetes or develop locally
