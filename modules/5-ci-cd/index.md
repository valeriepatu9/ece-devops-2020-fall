# Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

CI/CD brings automation into the DevOps lifecycle. With less manual work, DevOps teams work more efficiently and with greater speed. An automated workflow also reduces the chance of human error and improves handoffs, which improves overall operational efficiency. Organizations that implement CI/CD make better use of their resources and will have a competitive edge over those that don't use CI/CD.
